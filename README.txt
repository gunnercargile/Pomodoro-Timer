Use the input field to set the desired work time duration (in minutes).
Click the "Start" button to begin a Pomodoro session.
The timer will count down and display the remaining time visually.
An audio cue will play when the Pomodoro session ends.
You can take a short break (ideally 5 minutes) and repeat steps 2-5 for further Pomodoro sessions.
Use the "Pause" button to temporarily stop the timer and "Resume" to continue.
Use the "Reset" button to cancel the current Pomodoro session and return to the initial state.
